# 2D Platformer

"You can try to hide, we don't mind,
We will find you, UwU." 

Uwu is a 2D platformer where you try to escape from a haunted manor, using **a magic flashlight coming from your mouse that magically stops ghosts from moving**. Help your avatar find the key as best as you can, but remember that you have a single flashlight to lighten the path and stop the ghosts from walking onto you. As you go forward to reach your objective, so do they...
