# We Will Find You UwU [Global Game Jam 2021]

"You can try to hide, we don't mind,
We will find you, UwU." 

Uwu is a 2D platformer where you try to escape from a haunted manor, using **a magic flashlight coming from your mouse that magically stops ghosts from moving**. Help your avatar find the key as best as you can, but remember that you have a single flashlight that you'll need both to find your way and to stop the ghosts trying to hug you. As you go forward to reach your objective, so do they...

## Global Game Jam 2021

This game was completed in less than 48 hours during Global Game Jam 2021. Our team was composed of one music composer and two software engineers who had never used a game engine before. We got familiar with the Godot Engine on the fly and successfully delivered our game within the time limit.
